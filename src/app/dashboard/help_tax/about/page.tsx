        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union Territory (U.T). of Daman & Diu
        is a centrally administered territory without legislature. The territory
        was under Portugal Rule up to its liberation i.e. up to 19/12/1961. The
        GOI had exempted this U.T. from Sales tax regime. However, with the
        increase in Industries, Trade and commercial activities in the U.T.,
        there was persistence from the neighbouring States to discontinue the
        exemption of tax to avoid unhealthy competition of prices among the
        neighboring States; it was decided to impose sales tax in the U.T.

      <p className="mt-4 font-normal text-sm leading-5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Daman & Diu Sales Tax Act
        & Rules, 1964 and rules made there under and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956
        for Sales Tax came in to force from 1964. Further with the
        implementation of VAT Policy at all India level, the Daman & Diu
        Regulation 2005 & Daman & Diu Value Added Rules 2005 were enforced with
        effect from 01.04.2005. Thus at present following tax laws are in force.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three stages in taxation. The
        first is the incidence of tax, the second is quantification or
        assessment of tax and the third is the recovery of tax. A dealer liable
        to pay tax has to take a certificate of registration from the
        Department, although his liability which is dependent only on the
        taxable event does not depend on Registration.
